
// Here, b is the function prototype because it only mentions the parameter type
// and lacks an actual reference to a variable.

// a, is the function definition, because it mentions the placeholder variable name
// that is to be passed on to the function.

// c, is the function call, since an actual value of type double is being passed on
// to the function.
